# Sparse Matrix Operations

This project implements sparse matrix operations such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication using custom data structures to optimize memory usage and runtime.

## Features

- Load two sparse matrices from input files
- Perform matrix addition, subtraction, and multiplication
- Save the result matrix to an output file in the same format
- Handle input variations such as whitespaces and invalid formats
- Implement custom exception handling for incorrect input formats
